/**
 * DOC: i915 Perf Overview
 *
 * Gen graphics supports a large number of performance counters that can help
 * driver and application developers understand and optimize their use of the
 * GPU.
 *
 * This i915 perf interface enables userspace to configure and open a file
 * descriptor representing a stream of GPU metrics which can then be read() as
 * a stream of sample records.
 *
 * The interface is particularly suited to exposing buffered metrics that are
 * captured by DMA from the GPU, unsynchronized with and unrelated to the CPU.
 *
 * Streams representing a single context are accessible to applications with a
 * corresponding drm file descriptor, such that OpenGL can use the interface
 * without special privileges. Access to system-wide metrics requires root
 * privileges by default, unless changed via the dev.i915.perf_event_paranoid
 * sysctl option.
 *
 */

/**
 * DOC: i915 Perf History and Comparison with Core Perf
 *
 * The interface was initially inspired by the core Perf infrastructure but
 * some notable differences are:
 *
 * i915 perf file descriptors represent a "stream" instead of an "event"; where
 * a perf event primarily corresponds to a single 64bit value, while a stream
 * might sample sets of tightly-coupled counters, depending on the
 * configuration.  For example the Gen OA unit isn't designed to support
 * orthogonal configurations of individual counters; it's configured for a set
 * of related counters. Samples for an i915 perf stream capturing OA metrics
 * will include a set of counter values packed in a compact HW specific format.
 * The OA unit supports a number of different packing formats which can be
 * selected by the user opening the stream. Perf has support for grouping
 * events, but each event in the group is configured, validated and
 * authenticated individually with separate system calls.
 *
 * i915 perf stream configurations are provided as an array of u64 (key,value)
 * pairs, instead of a fixed struct with multiple miscellaneous config members,
 * interleaved with event-type specific members.
 *
 * i915 perf doesn't support exposing metrics via an mmap'd circular buffer.
 * The supported metrics are being written to memory by the GPU unsynchronized
 * with the CPU, using HW specific packing formats for counter sets. Sometimes
 * the constraints on HW configuration require reports to be filtered before it
 * would be acceptable to expose them to unprivileged applications - to hide
 * the metrics of other processes/contexts. For these use cases a read() based
 * interface is a good fit, and provides an opportunity to filter data as it
 * gets copied from the GPU mapped buffers to userspace buffers.
 *
 *
 * Issues hit with first prototype based on Core Perf
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * The first prototype of this driver was based on the core perf
 * infrastructure, and while we did make that mostly work, with some changes to
 * perf, we found we were breaking or working around too many assumptions baked
 * into perf's currently cpu centric design.
 *
 * In the end we didn't see a clear benefit to making perf's implementation and
 * interface more complex by changing design assumptions while we knew we still
 * wouldn't be able to use any existing perf based userspace tools.
 *
 * Also considering the Gen specific nature of the Observability hardware and
 * how userspace will sometimes need to combine i915 perf OA metrics with
 * side-band OA data captured via MI_REPORT_PERF_COUNT commands; we're
 * expecting the interface to be used by a platform specific userspace such as
 * OpenGL or tools. This is to say; we aren't inherently missing out on having
 * a standard vendor/architecture agnostic interface by not using perf.
 *
 *
 * For posterity, in case we might re-visit trying to adapt core perf to be
 * better suited to exposing i915 metrics these were the main pain points we
 * hit:
 *
 * - The perf based OA PMU driver broke some significant design assumptions:
 *
 *   Existing perf pmus are used for profiling work on a cpu and we were
 *   introducing the idea of _IS_DEVICE pmus with different security
 *   implications, the need to fake cpu-related data (such as user/kernel
 *   registers) to fit with perf's current design, and adding _DEVICE records
 *   as a way to forward device-specific status records.
 *
 *   The OA unit writes reports of counters into a circular buffer, without
 *   involvement from the CPU, making our PMU driver the first of a kind.
 *
 *   Given the way we were periodically forward data from the GPU-mapped, OA
 *   buffer to perf's buffer, those bursts of sample writes looked to perf like
 *   we were sampling too fast and so we had to subvert its throttling checks.
 *
 *   Perf supports groups of counters and allows those to be read via
 *   transactions internally but transactions currently seem designed to be
 *   explicitly initiated from the cpu (say in response to a userspace read())
 *   and while we could pull a report out of the OA buffer we can't
 *   trigger a report from the cpu on demand.
 *
 *   Related to being report based; the OA counters are configured in HW as a
 *   set while perf generally expects counter configurations to be orthogonal.
 *   Although counters can be associated with a group leader as they are
 *   opened, there's no clear precedent for being able to provide group-wide
 *   configuration attributes (for example we want to let userspace choose the
 *   OA unit report format used to capture all counters in a set, or specify a
 *   GPU context to filter metrics on). We avoided using perf's grouping
 *   feature and forwarded OA reports to userspace via perf's 'raw' sample
 *   field. This suited our userspace well considering how coupled the counters
 *   are when dealing with normalizing. It would be inconvenient to split
 *   counters up into separate events, only to require userspace to recombine
 *   them. For Mesa it's also convenient to be forwarded raw, periodic reports
 *   for combining with the side-band raw reports it captures using
 *   MI_REPORT_PERF_COUNT commands.
 *
 *   - As a side note on perf's grouping feature; there was also some concern
 *     that using PERF_FORMAT_GROUP as a way to pack together counter values
 *     would quite drastically inflate our sample sizes, which would likely
 *     lower the effective sampling resolutions we could use when the available
 *     memory bandwidth is limited.
 *
 *     With the OA unit's report formats, counters are packed together as 32
 *     or 40bit values, with the largest report size being 256 bytes.
 *
 *     PERF_FORMAT_GROUP values are 64bit, but there doesn't appear to be a
 *     documented ordering to the values, implying PERF_FORMAT_ID must also be
 *     used to add a 64bit ID before each value; giving 16 bytes per counter.
 *
 *   Related to counter orthogonality; we can't time share the OA unit, while
 *   event scheduling is a central design idea within perf for allowing
 *   userspace to open + enable more events than can be configured in HW at any
 *   one time.  The OA unit is not designed to allow re-configuration while in
 *   use. We can't reconfigure the OA unit without losing internal OA unit
 *   state which we can't access explicitly to save and restore. Reconfiguring
 *   the OA unit is also relatively slow, involving ~100 register writes. From
 *   userspace Mesa also depends on a stable OA configuration when emitting
 *   MI_REPORT_PERF_COUNT commands and importantly the OA unit can't be
 *   disabled while there are outstanding MI_RPC commands lest we hang the
 *   command streamer.
 *
 *   The contents of sample records aren't extensible by device drivers (i.e.
 *   the sample_type bits). As an example; Sourab Gupta had been looking to
 *   attach GPU timestamps to our OA samples. We were shoehorning OA reports
 *   into sample records by using the 'raw' field, but it's tricky to pack more
 *   than one thing into this field because events/core.c currently only lets a
 *   pmu give a single raw data pointer plus len which will be copied into the
 *   ring buffer. To include more than the OA report we'd have to copy the
 *   report into an intermediate larger buffer. I'd been considering allowing a
 *   vector of data+len values to be specified for copying the raw data, but
 *   it felt like a kludge to being using the raw field for this purpose.
 *
 * - It felt like our perf based PMU was making some technical compromises
 *   just for the sake of using perf:
 *
 *   perf_event_open() requires events to either relate to a pid or a specific
 *   cpu core, while our device pmu related to neither.  Events opened with a
 *   pid will be automatically enabled/disabled according to the scheduling of
 *   that process - so not appropriate for us. When an event is related to a
 *   cpu id, perf ensures pmu methods will be invoked via an inter process
 *   interrupt on that core. To avoid invasive changes our userspace opened OA
 *   perf events for a specific cpu. This was workable but it meant the
 *   majority of the OA driver ran in atomic context, including all OA report
 *   forwarding, which wasn't really necessary in our case and seems to make
 *   our locking requirements somewhat complex as we handled the interaction
 *   with the rest of the i915 driver.

/**
 * DOC: OA Tail Pointer Race
 *
 * There's a HW race condition between OA unit tail pointer register updates and
 * writes to memory whereby the tail pointer can sometimes get ahead of what's
 * been written out to the OA buffer so far (in terms of what's visible to the
 * CPU).
 *
 * Although this can be observed explicitly while copying reports to userspace
 * by checking for a zeroed report-id field in tail reports, we want to account
 * for this earlier, as part of the _oa_buffer_check to avoid lots of redundant
 * read() attempts.
 *
 * In effect we define a tail pointer for reading that lags the real tail
 * pointer by at least %OA_TAIL_MARGIN_NSEC nanoseconds, which gives enough
 * time for the corresponding reports to become visible to the CPU.
 *
 * To manage this we actually track two tail pointers:
 *  1) An 'aging' tail with an associated timestamp that is tracked until we
 *     can trust the corresponding data is visible to the CPU; at which point
 *     it is considered 'aged'.
 *  2) An 'aged' tail that can be used for read()ing.
 *
 * The two separate pointers let us decouple read()s from tail pointer aging.
 *
 * The tail pointers are checked and updated at a limited rate within a hrtimer
 * callback (the same callback that is used for delivering POLLIN events)
 *
 * Initially the tails are marked invalid with %INVALID_TAIL_PTR which
 * indicates that an updated tail pointer is needed.
 *
 * Most of the implementation details for this workaround are in
 * gen7_oa_buffer_check_unlocked() and gen7_appand_oa_reports()
 *
 * Note for posterity: previously the driver used to define an effective tail
 * pointer that lagged the real pointer by a 'tail margin' measured in bytes
 * derived from %OA_TAIL_MARGIN_NSEC and the configured sampling frequency.
 * This was flawed considering that the OA unit may also automatically generate
 * non-periodic reports (such as on context switch) or the OA unit may be
 * enabled without any periodic sampling.
